# CS-330
In this course we explored OpenGL with C++, creating a 3D scene
Developing this scene, I wanted to challenge myself to really learn the concepts. I may have bit off more than I can chew but I have learned quite a bit and enjoyed this class. I chose to build the room with various cubes as walls and the floor, I created the plane, I created the base of the bed, from there I struggled to implement lighting properly and that carried over into the last week which left me short on time to implement the sphere’s outside and other structure inside. I attempted to implement a Sphere.h file and create a planet outside the room, the scene renders but the sphere does not and that is where I ran into a wall and unfortunately out of time. A user can navigate the scene simply by using the ASDW keys to go left, right, forward, and backward. The QE keys are used to navigate up and down. The mouse or mouse pad is used to look around. The only modular aspect I created in this project are the various mesh’s to create each object in the scene. Each object had it’s own mesh method containing the vertex coordinates, texture coordinates. The render method called each mesh and drew each to the screen.
